This is a text file to help compile the fem/aeros code using cmake.

note: this text file may be incomplete as cmake has only been tested on a macbook (OSX i386)
note: calls for pita routines need to be commented in main.C
note: the cmake option has been created by Michel Lesoinne and modified by JF Dord in February 2009.


In order to use cmake, 
- first type "cmake -i ."
   + the fine options can be chosen here
   + the debug/release option is chosen here
   + a summary is given at the end (it may need improvement)
   + a detailed summary of options and links to libraries is printed in CMakeCache.txt


- to compile the executable type "make"

On nivation: Make sure /opt/intel/fc/9.0/bin is in your path.
~michel/cmake-2.6.2-Linux-i386/bin/cmake -DEXTRALIB="-L/opt/intel/fc/9.0/lib/ -lifcore" .

On regelation, make sure /share/apps/intel/fce/9.1.039/bin/ is in your path and use:
~michel/cmake-2.6.2-Linux-i386/bin/cmake -DEXTRALIB="-L/share/apps/intel/fce/9.1.039/lib/ -lifcore -limf -lirc" -DMPI_INCLUDE_PATH=/opt/mpich/myrinet/gnu/include .

Note: Both directories given above can be in your path. Only one of them will contain a fortran compiler and cmake will pick it.
