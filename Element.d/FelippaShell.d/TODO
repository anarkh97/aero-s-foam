andesms.cpp

1. local stress computation is not supported for shell material type 1 (COEF composite). I think it is not possible, but need to check.
2. support output of "generalized stresses" i.e. N,M (force and moment per unit length)
3. epszz is only computed correctly for isotropic plane stress material.
4. restart (save internal variables).
5. output of internal variables
6. time-integration of internal variables for dynamics. consider using MatNLCorotator
7. consistent and boundary-consistent mass, body force and surface tractions.
8. optimizations using eigen3, eg symmetry, aligned map, fixed size blocks
